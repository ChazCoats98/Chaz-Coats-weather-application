## Weather App Description
The goal of this project was to build a working weather app where the user could search by city and display a 5 day weather forecast for that city, then save that searched city to re run the search at a later date. As you can see I got a bit too ambitious. I started on this project early so i had extra time and my need to be the best at everything took over. Originally my plan was to make a 70s themed weather website with 70s ads and 70s news articles from the current days date in 1973. I was trying to learn as much as i could and get some practice in before we moved on. I had time to get it working but unfortunately other life events got in the way and i got a bit burnt out on it. I hope to come back and finish it some day in the future, maybe implimenting weather forecasts from the current day in 1973 as well. 

## lessons learned
The main lesson i learned was the importance of starting with the minimum functioning product and then building on that. I'll definitely apply this mindset to future projects.
